  "body": "We built the NYU VM using freely available software and services.  You can use the same approach to build your own VM system.\r\n\r\n**What you will need:**\r\n\r\n* Digital Slides in the Aperio SVS format\r\n* A computer to convert the SVS files into Google Maps-compatible image tiles.  This should be a fast computer running 64 bit linux and ideally SSD drives.  This machine should not be the same as your VM application server as the slide processing is very resource intensive while running\r\n* Server(s) for your application and your tiled slide images:\r\n * Your application can be in any framework your local development teams work in.  The Google Maps API is Javascript based and can be easily integrated into any web framework.\r\n * The conversion process converts each SVS file into anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 individual JPEG tiles, so you may consider separating your application/db and your static image file servers.",
